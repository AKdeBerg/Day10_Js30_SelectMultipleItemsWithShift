<img width = 700 align="center" src="./img/cover.gif"/>

First check a checkbox and then check another one holding the shift key down; hoo! all the items in between will be selected

## Tech I Used
This app is purely made with vanilla JavaScript & raw HTML/CSS. It is to demonstrate, if you can be creative you can make something amazing out of those core technologies.

Key topics-
+ **HTML:** I used custom div and checkbox input
+ **CSS:** I used Flexbox to position the items, and other trivial properties to style it.
+ **JS:** I used DOM manipulation technique to get the result.
